- Allow for up to 100 pieces of data to be input simultaneously

- Output the requested result

Once you schedule a technical interview, your submission will be reviewed by the technical interview team.  If it is determined that your submission does not meet the stated "complete" requirements, your interview will be cancelled.

The score assigned at the end of the assignment purely reflects uploading a document, not completeness.
